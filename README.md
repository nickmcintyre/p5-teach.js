# p5-teach.js
This project would involve developing tools for teaching through p5.js, adding functions to animate shapes and exporting the animation in different formats (mp4 or webm). Main focus is to introduce a simple, easy to use library to animate and make scenes. This will also take advantage of p5.js core library - p5.sound.js for sound effects.
